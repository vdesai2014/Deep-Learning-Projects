In order to better understand artificial neural networks, I implemented a feed-forward deep neural network in Python and built a visualizer to understand how layer activations changed as training progressed. The network shown here is learning a very simple "exclusive-or" function, and is expected to output a "1" if and only if the input arguments differ. The visualization is a bit inaccurate in that it is showing the result of the summation function 


shows the nueronal activation between neurons changing over time, whereas this section of a neural network visualization is typically understood as the "weight" associated with that link. My visualization shows
